Board Game Geek data dump scripts
=================================

This is a series of hacky scripts that uses BoardGameGeek's API to
download a complete dump of BoardGameGeek's database of board games
and the "Geeklists" created by site users. I run these scripts every
July and publish the historical data to track changes in the board
game industry and how peoples' feelings about games change over time.

Even if you need this data, you probably never need to run these
scripts, but here they are in case I stop doing this project or
whatever.

To get a complete data dump, run the scripts in order. The first two
scripts download the data; the last two convert it from XML to a more
usable JSON format.

Downloading the games will take a few hours; downloading the geeklists
takes quite a long time.
